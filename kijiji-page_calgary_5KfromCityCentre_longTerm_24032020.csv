I am seeking a two bedroom apartment in Calgary, AB. The rental unit would be for myself, Katherine, and my friend, Eric. We are both responsible, working professionals.
To share a little about ourselves, I myself am a Social Service Worker and Eric is a Licensed Funeral Director. We share similar values such as respect and kindness. We are both friendly, clean, quiet, and organized individuals. We are reliable and respectful tenants with references to reflect this as well.
Eric and I are moving to Calgary, AB in October 2020. We are looking for a furnished unit as we are moving from Ontario and prefer not to move our furniture over province. The following is a list of preferences:
• 2 bedroom (or 1 bedroom + den)
• Furnished
• Heat, hydro, and water included
• Laundry in unit or on site
• Parking for 2 vehicles
• $1,000.00 - $1,300.00/month
We are both non-smoking, and we would be willing to pay first and last.
We hope to find the right fit to meet our needs. Your time is much appreciated! If you feel you have a space that matches what we are seeking, please feel free to contacts us. You can email, katherine_c690@hotmail.com or reply to this ad.
