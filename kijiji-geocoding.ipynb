    "## Introduction\n",
    "I do GIS professionally and thought that the best thing I could do to help would be to do what's called [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) to the Kijiji datasets that have been provided. Geocoding is the process where you convert the address of a physical location to a latitude/longitude coordinate pair. It was mentioned as being a stretch goal and I thought this was no better time to help the Calgary community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "I intend to use OpenStreetMap's geocoder, Nominatim, to do the heavy lifting for me. It has a handy set of [APIs](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/) that make this kind of work straightforward. My plan to do this is to read the input `.csv` files, put them into dataframes, then iterate through the addresses with Python's `requests` library. I will create two additional columns in the dataframes to store the latitude and longitude values where each record's values will be written after they're geocoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to have a quick look at some of the values that Nominatim returns to show that it works and to practice using `folium`, which is a neat library I've seen in a number of projects but never had the chance to use myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "Looks like the main challenge in this project will be parsing each address into something that Nominatim can use. Hopefully the `location` values are properly separated by commas because that will make my life a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, without further ado, let's get started!"
